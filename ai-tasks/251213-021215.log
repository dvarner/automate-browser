## Issues/Blockers

**None** - All identified issues were resolved during this session.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Explicit Color Styling Required:** PyQt6 widgets don't always inherit appropriate colors from themes. Always set explicit colors for critical UI elements (text, buttons).

2. **Iterative Testing:** User testing revealed additional text color issues after initial fix. Always test all dialogs and UI states.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Creating DEVELOPMENT.md early helps with onboarding and reduces future questions about project setup.

4. **Feature Planning:** Documenting features before implementation ensures alignment and helps prioritize work effectively.

5. **Git Workflow:** Following conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:) makes commit history readable and professional.
